# CAKStatistics
Communications Authority of Kenya's (CA) Quarterly Statistics from 2015 till now

# The problem:
Over the year, the CA has produced quartely reports on the statistics on the telecom and internet market in Kenya. However, the data is not found in any uniform database 
to the public and this project helps to get qualitative statistics over the years. We have decide to work data from 2017 to 2023 and we hope to improve the data as we
move forward.
